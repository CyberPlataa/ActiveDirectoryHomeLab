# ActiveDirectoryHomeLab
All things related to my active directory experiments!
Loaded an ISO into virtualbox and got to work. After windows server 2016 was installed. 
Started getting into best practices and named my server DC01-WV bc I am from WV and it sounds way more legit compared to the name it was giving me. 
Went through and created my forest, then setting up Active Directory by installing it from the manage window.
